# DOTFILES

These are files and folders that generally start with a dot (.) in your
home folder. The dotfiles in this repository reflect my personal
preferences for software that I use often, and want the settings to be
easily transferred from one computer to another.

# LICENSE

MIT (see LICENSE)

# INSTALL

git clone https://github.com/unixmonkey/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles

# NOTES

If a dotfile already exists, it will be backed up in a timestamped folder.
